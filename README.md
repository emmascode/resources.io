## resources.io

This documents contains the resources that have helped me learn programming. When I first started, I felt overwhelmed not only by the amount of knowledge I needed to learn but also by the number of resouces available. There are computer science programs, MOOC courses, udemy courses, bootcamps, websites dedicated to teaching programming skills, books, tutorials, YouTube channels... At the beginning, I wasn't sure what to follow, so I just spent time on trying out different options. On one hand, that allowed me to explore different tech stacks. On the other hand, since I also self-studied programming besides my full-time job at the time, that also meant I spent my valuable time on ineffective resources and led to frustrations. While I found some increadibly helpful, some were not up to expectaion. So I created this documents to save the ones were most useful to me and hopefully, that'd save you time and make your learning more enjoyable. Most recommendations below are free or budget-friendly.
